# Q1d

Simple program to represent steady, quasi-one-dimensional, internal compressible flow with area change and heat addition.
    
Method derived from ["Steady, quasi-one-dimensional, internal compressible flow with area change, heat addition and friction"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/steady-quasionedimensional-internal-compressible-flow-with-area-change-heat-addition-and-friction/941B60C217C6096C6980DFDD4B5F9E34?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark)
 by Andrew A. Oliva and Scott C. Morris.

## Notes
- Currently does not support friction or non-uniform gas property profiles.
